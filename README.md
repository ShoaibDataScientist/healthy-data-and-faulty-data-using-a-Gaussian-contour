# healthy-data-and-faulty-data-using-a-Gaussian-contour
In this code, we generated two sets of data: "healthy data" and "faulty data". Both sets of data were generated using a Gaussian distribution, but with different means and variances.

Next, we plotted a Gaussian contour for both sets of data to visualize their distributions. The contour plot helps us to visualize the density of the data points in 2D.

We also plotted a time series graph for both sets of data to visualize the change in their values over time.

Finally, we used the Chi squared value to validate the difference between the healthy data and faulty data. The Chi squared value is a statistical measure of the difference between two sets of data, and a larger value indicates a significant difference between the two sets.

In summary, this code demonstrates how to generate and visualize healthy and faulty data, and how to use the Chi squared value to validate the difference between the two sets of data
